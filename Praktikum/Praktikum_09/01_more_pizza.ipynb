    "## Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "You are organizing a Hash Code hub and want to order pizza for participants. Luckily,\n",
    "there is a nearby pizzeria with really good pizza.\n",
    "The pizzeria has different types of pizza, and to keep the food ordering interesting, we\n",
    "can only order **at most one pizza of each type**. Fortunately, there are many types of\n",
    "pizza to choose from!\n",
    "Each type of pizza has a specified size: the size is the number of pizza slices in it.\n",
    "Based on the number of participants, you estimated a maximum number of slices that\n",
    "you want to order – in order to reduce waste, the goal is to order **as many pizza slices\n",
    "as possible** , but **not more than the maximum number**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input data set\n",
    "\n",
    "## File format\n",
    "\n",
    "Each input data set is provided in a plain text file containing exclusively ASCII\n",
    "characters with lines terminated with a single '\\n' character (UNIX- style line endings).\n",
    "When a single line contains multiple elements, they are separated by single spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of the data set contains the following data:\n",
    "- an integer M ( 1 ≤ **M** ≤ 10^9 ) – the maximum number of pizza slices to order\n",
    "- an integer N ( 1 ≤ **N** ≤ 10^5 ) – the number of different types of pizza\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line contains N integers: the number of slices in each type of pizza, in\n",
    "non-decreasing order:\n",
    "- 1 ≤ S 0 ≤ S 1 ≤ ... ≤ S N-1 <= M\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Input file | Description |\n",
    "|------------|:------------------------:|\n",
    "| `17 4`     | 17 slices maximum, 4 dierent types of pizza |\n",
    "| `2 5 6 8`  | type 0 has 2 slices, type 1 has 5 , type 2 has 6 , and type 3 has 8 slices |\n",

    "## Submissions\n",
    "\n",
    "### File format\n",
    "\n",
    "The output should contain two lines:\n",
    "- The first line should contain a single integer K (0 ≤ K ≤ N ) – the number of\n",
    "dierent types of pizza to order.\n",
    "- The second line should contain K numbers – the types of pizza to order (the types of pizza are numbered from 0 to N - 1 in the order they are listed in the input).\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of slices in the ordered pizzas must be less than or equal to **M**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "|Submission file | Description |\n",
    "|----------------|-------------|\n",
    "|3               | 3 types of pizza |\n",

    "## Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution gets 1 point for each slice of pizza ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **example** , above we ordered 3 pizzas: **S 0** , **S 2** and **S 3**. We know that the slices of\n",
    "each of these are 2, 6 and 8 correspondingly.\n",
    "So the score is: 2+6+8 = **16 points**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are multiple data sets representing separate instances of the\n",
    "problem. The final score for your team will be the sum of your best scores for the\n",
    "individual data sets.\n"
